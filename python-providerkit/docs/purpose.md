## ProviderKit

**ProviderKit** is a generic provider management library for Python. It provides a standardized way to manage, discover, and interact with multiple service providers in a unified manner.

### Core Functionality

The library enables you to:

1. **Discover and enumerate providers** with essential metadata:
   - Provider name (human-readable)
   - Unique identifier (for programmatic access)
   - Dependency package availability (check if required packages are installed)
   - Configuration readiness (verify if provider is properly configured)
   - Documentation access (links to provider documentation)
   - Status information (provider availability, health, etc.)
   - Website URL (provider's official site)

2. **Implement business logic** through a modular mixin-based architecture:
   - **`kit/__init__.py`**: Core provider base class (`ProviderBase`) that combines all mixins
   - **`kit/package.py`**: Package dependency management and validation (`PackageMixin`)
   - **`kit/service.py`**: Business logic implementation and service methods (`ServiceMixin`)
   - **`kit/urls.py`**: URL routing and endpoint management (`UrlsMixin`, if applicable)
   - **`kit/config.py`**: Configuration management and validation (`ConfigMixin`)

### Architecture

The library uses a mixin pattern to separate concerns:

- Each provider can implement one or more mixins depending on its needs
- Mixins are organized in dedicated files for clear separation of concerns
- Providers can be discovered, queried, and used programmatically
- The system validates dependencies and configuration before allowing provider usage

### Use Cases

- Multi-provider integrations (email, SMS, payment, etc.)
- Provider fallback mechanisms
- Provider discovery and selection
- Configuration validation across multiple providers
- Unified interface for heterogeneous services
